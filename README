Config-Source

This module allows defining and loading multiple sources to generate a configuration. 

Sometimes you want a configuration initially provided by your application, but partially or 
fully redefined at multiple locations. You can have a default configuration
distributed with your program and under your control as developer. 
On the first startup you want to generate a user configuration file to 
store individual relevant data. And for the administration, you want to provide a 
central configuration file indented to specify shared resources. You may also 
want a file which is only loaded on debug sessions.

This module uses Perl data structures for representing your configuration. It can also assure, 
that you only work with a true copy of the data.
